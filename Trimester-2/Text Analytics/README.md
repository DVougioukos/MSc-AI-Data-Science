# Text Analytics

This folder contains my coursework and assignments for the "Text Analytics" module, part of the MSc in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science (Trimester 2). The course focused on modern techniques for extracting, modeling, and interpreting information from natural language using both traditional and deep learning-based NLP methods.

## ðŸ“– Course Overview

This course introduced key **algorithms and architectures for Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, emphasizing their application in real-world text analytics tasks. It explored both classical statistical techniques and advanced neural models, ranging from n-gram language modeling to transformers and large language models (LLMs).

The course covered topics such as:
- N-gram models, entropy, perplexity, and spelling correction  
- Text classification using linear models and TF-IDF representations  
- Deep learning for NLP with **MLPs**, **RNNs**, and **CNNs**  
- Transformer-based architectures including **BERT**, **T5**, and **GPT**  
- Prompting and fine-tuning **Large Language Models (LLMs)**  
- Applications in **sentiment analysis**, **NER**, **machine translation**, and **speech/dialog systems**

By the end of the course, I gained practical experience in:
- Implementing NLP models across various architectures  
- Preprocessing and encoding natural language text for downstream tasks  
- Fine-tuning and prompting LLMs for text understanding and generation  
- Evaluating models with task-appropriate metrics and performance diagnostics  
- Understanding the role of text analytics in enterprise and societal contexts  

The coursework included **five programming assignments**, each targeting different components of modern NLP workflows. These assignments are documented below.
