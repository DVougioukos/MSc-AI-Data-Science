# Legal and Ethical Issues in Data Science

This folder contains my coursework for the "Legal and Ethical Issues in Data Science" module, part of the MSc in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science (Trimester 2). The course focused on exploring the legal, regulatory, and ethical dimensions of data-driven technologies and how these intersect with evolving fields such as AI, public data governance, intellectual property, and privacy.

## üìñ Course Overview

This course examined the complex landscape of **law, ethics, and data science**, emphasizing the design and implementation of **techno-regulatory approaches** that address emerging challenges in the digital age. Rather than offering definitive legal solutions, the course prioritized critical thinking and methodology for analyzing and resolving legal and ethical issues that arise in data-centric systems.

The course covered thematic areas such as:
- Techno-regulation and data governance  
- **Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)** in research and cultural domains  
- **Public Sector Information law** (access, reuse, and geodata entrepreneurship)  
- Legal and ethical frameworks in **research and education**  
- **Personal data protection**, bioethics, and healthcare data  
- Emerging legal challenges in **IoT**, **meta-products**, and **phigital items**

By the end of the course, I developed the ability to:
- Analyze legal frameworks and regulatory mechanisms for data science applications  
- Evaluate ethical implications of AI across diverse domains  
- Design innovative, context-aware techno-regulatory systems  
- Navigate legal concerns in real-world sectors like public administration, life sciences, and digital culture  
- Collaborate on interdisciplinary approaches for socially responsible data science

The coursework included a **collaborative research paper**, described below.

### üìù Assignment ‚Äì Research Paper on AI in Healthcare

- **Summary:**  
  Together with my colleague **Ioannis Papadopoulos**, we co-authored a research paper titled:  
  **"The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare: Benefits, Risks, and Future Directions"**. The paper explored the transformative impact of AI on the healthcare sector from a legal, ethical, and societal lens. It focused on the balance between innovation and responsibility, analyzing how regulatory and ethical frameworks must evolve alongside AI technologies in medicine.

- **Focus Areas:**  
  - Evaluated **benefits** of AI in diagnostics, treatment planning, and personalized medicine  
  - Identified key **risks**, including algorithmic bias, data privacy, accountability, and transparency  
  - Investigated **ethical dilemmas** in using patient data and autonomous decision-making systems  
  - Analyzed current **legal frameworks** (e.g., GDPR, medical device regulation) and their applicability  
  - Proposed **future directions** for policy-making, regulation, and techno-ethical design in AI healthcare systems

- **Deliverables:**  
  - Full research paper with in-text references and critical analysis  
  - A concise summary of legal and ethical challenges tied to healthcare AI  
  - Reflections on the future role of AI in improving human well-being within legal constraints

## üìå Wrapping Up

This course provided a critical lens through which to examine the intersection of data science, law, and ethics. By engaging with real-world case studies and regulatory frameworks, i developed a deeper understanding of the responsibilities data scientists carry when working with sensitive, high-impact data.

The collaborative research paper on AI in healthcare allowed me to explore the balance between technological innovation and ethical governance. Overall, the course strengthened my ability to identify legal risks, propose regulatory solutions, and contribute to the development of data-driven systems that are both effective and socially responsible.
