# MSc in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science

This repository includes a collection of projects, assignments, and the final capstone project developed during my Master of Science (MSc) in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at the Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB), in the academic year 2024‚Äì2025.

## üìñ Program Overview

The MSc in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at the Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB), jointly organized by the Department of Informatics and the Department of Statistics, offered me a deep and well-rounded education in both the theoretical and practical aspects of data science and artificial intelligence.

Over the courses of this program, i had the opportunity to engage with a wide variety of subjects, from foundational concepts like probability theory and statistical inference to more advanced topics such as deep learning, knowledge graphs, and large-scale data management. Each course was thoughtfully designed to build relevant, hands-on experience while grounding it in solid academic theory.

Some of the key skills and experiences i gained through the coursework include:

- Translating business problems into data-driven solutions using machine learning and statistical modeling techniques.
- Build and optimize machine learning models for prediction and decision-making.
- Storing, analyzing, and presenting data using modern algorithmic and computational tools.
- Designing and training deep learning models for real-world applications.
- Using optimization techniques and numerical methods to improve model performance and computational efficiency.
- Applying probability theory, statistics, and algebra to understand and model complex data systems.
- Working with large datasets and building scalable data pipelines using modern big data tools.
- Visualizing data and communicating insights clearly to technical and non-technical audiences.
- Exploring how legal, ethical, and societal considerations shape the development and deployment of AI systems.


Throughout the program, i worked on hands-on data science projects and became exposed to real-world scenarios requiring innovative solutions. Collaborating with professors and fellow students on hands-on projects gave me a better understanding of how data science can be applied to solve practical problems and how rapidly evolving AI technologies can reshape industries.

## üéì Capstone Project: Virtual AI Agent for Natural Language Data Exploration

**Expected Completion:** November 1, 2025

### üîç Project Summary

This project focuses on building a virtual AI agent that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact directly with a structured relational database. The agent allows users to ask natural language questions and receive meaningful responses by translating queries into optimized SQL, executing them, and returning the results in a user-friendly format.

The goal is to create an intuitive interface for exploring structured data, with attention to query accuracy, security, and performance, ultimately making database access more accessible to non-technical users and supporting informed decision-making.

Additional content will be included as the project advances.

üìå Wrapping Up

This repository represents the comprehensive body of work completed during my MSc in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at AUEB. While all coursework projects are finalized and included here, the capstone project remains in active development. I will continue to update this repository with new code, documentation, and insights as the capstone progresses, reflecting the culmination of my academic and practical experience.

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or reach out if you would like to connect or collaborate.
