# Machine Learning and Computational Statistics

This folder contains my coursework and final project for the "Machine Learning and Computational Statistics" module, part of the MSc in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science (Trimester 1). The course introduced the foundations and advanced topics of machine learning, combining statistical learning theory with practical algorithmic implementation. It also emphasized model selection, optimization, and hands-on application on real-world data.

## üìñ Course Overview

This course provided a broad introduction to **Machine Learning**, focusing on both theoretical principles and practical skills. Topics included supervised and unsupervised learning methods, model evaluation, and dimensionality reduction.

The course consisted of **10 weekly homework assignments** and **one final project**. The homeworks were designed to reinforce theoretical understanding through practical exercises, however, most of them were completed on paper or in non-digital format and are therefore not included in this repository. The final project, which is included here, offered a more comprehensive and applied challenge.

By the end of the course, I developed a solid understanding of:
- Classical models such as linear regression, logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors, and naive Bayes  
- Advanced techniques like support vector machines and neural networks  
- Model selection methods including cross-validation and regularization  
- Dimensionality reduction methods for high-dimensional data  
- Unsupervised learning through clustering and probabilistic latent variable models  
- Applying machine learning algorithms to real-world data science problems

## üìÇ Project

### üìù Hyperspectral Image Processing ‚Äì Unmixing and Classification

- **Summary:**  
  This project focused on processing **hyperspectral images (HSIs)** from the Salinas dataset, covering two major tasks: spectral unmixing and supervised classification. HSIs capture rich spectral data, and each pixel can represent multiple materials (mixed pixels). The aim was to extract sub-pixel information and classify each pixel accurately.

- **Focus Areas:**  
  **Part 1 ‚Äì Spectral Unmixing:**  
  - Applied five spectral unmixing methods: least squares (with and without constraints) and LASSO  
  - Generated abundance maps for seven endmembers
  - Evaluated models using reconstruction error and visual inspection
  - Compared the methods with respect to accuracy and interpretability  

  **Part 2 ‚Äì Classification:**  
  - Used four classifiers: Naive Bayes, Minimum Euclidean Distance, KNN, Bayesian  
  - Trained and validated models using 10-fold cross-validation  
  - Analyzed performance using confusion matrices and success rate  
  - Compared classifiers to identify strengths and weaknesses in class separation  

  **Part 3 ‚Äì Combined Analysis:**  
  - Briefly discussed how insights from unmixing related to classification outcomes  

- **Deliverables:**  
  - Full project implementation notebook  
  - Visualizations of abundance maps and confusion matrices  
  - Report analyzing methodology, results, and model comparisons

## üìå Wrapping Up

This course gave me a solid foundation in both the theory and practice of machine learning, while also improving my ability to critically evaluate model performance and choose appropriate algorithms based on real-world data characteristics. The project was particularly valuable for gaining hands-on experience in high-dimensional data processing, integrating both predictive modeling and signal interpretation techniques. It also helped reinforce a deeper understanding of how classical statistical learning and modern machine learning approaches intersect in applied settings.
