# Probability and Statistics in Data Analysis

This folder contains my coursework and assignments for the "Probability and Statistics in Data Analysis" module, part of the MSc in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science (Trimester 1). The course provided a solid theoretical foundation in probability and statistics, focusing on their applications in data analysis and research, with practical implementation using the statistical programming language **R**.

## üìñ Course Overview

This graduate-level course deepened my understanding of core concepts in **probability theory** and **statistical inference**, extending beyond undergraduate knowledge to cover advanced topics and practical applications. Emphasis was placed on selecting and implementing appropriate statistical methods for data analysis tasks.

Key topics included:
- Fundamentals of probability and random variables (univariate and multivariate)  
- Properties and behavior of random samples  
- Statistical inference principles, including hypothesis testing and estimation  
- Regression analysis theory and practice  
- Bayesian statistical methods and their comparison to classical (frequentist) approaches  

By the end of the course, I was able to:
- Understand and apply essential probability concepts in data analysis  
- Choose and implement the correct statistical inference techniques for various problems  
- Perform regression analysis with both classical and Bayesian methods  
- Implement statistical models and analyses using **R**  
- Critically evaluate results from different statistical approaches  

The coursework comprised two assignments, each designed to reinforce theoretical concepts through practical application. These assignments are detailed below.

## üìÇ Assignments

### üìù Assignment 1 ‚Äì Probability and Statistical Inference Exercises

- **Summary:**  
  This assignment consisted of a series of theoretical exercises designed to deepen understanding of fundamental concepts in probability and statistics. The exercises covered event probabilities, conditional probabilities, distributions, expectation, Poisson processes, sufficient statistics, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing.

- **Focus Areas:**  
  - Calculated probabilities involving events, unions, intersections, and independence  
  - Worked with geometric distributions modeling repeated trials until success  
  - Applied Bayes‚Äô theorem to communication channel error probabilities  
  - Proved properties of probability density functions (pdfs)  
  - Analyzed Poisson process probabilities for event counts over time intervals  
  - Derived sufficient statistics for parameters in Weibull distributions  
  - Constructed confidence intervals and performed hypothesis testing on sample means assuming normality  

- **Deliverables:**  
  - Written solutions to all exercises submitted in paper format

### üìù Assignment 2 ‚Äì Statistical Analysis Using R

- **Summary:**  
  This assignment focused on applying statistical inference and regression techniques using **R**. It involved analyzing clinical trial data and a multivariate dataset to perform confidence interval estimation, hypothesis testing, ANOVA, and regression modeling, combined with graphical exploration and model diagnostics.

- **Focus Areas:**  
  - Computed confidence intervals for means, mean differences, and proportions in clinical trial data  
  - Performed hypothesis testing on means, variances, proportions, and independence related to drug effects and side effects  
  - Conducted parametric one-way and two-way ANOVA tests on multiple continuous variables against categorical factors  
  - Created graphical summaries including scatter-plot matrices and categorical-variable plots  
  - Built and evaluated multiple regression models with interaction terms, checked model assumptions, and applied stepwise regression for model selection  
  - Provided predictions with confidence intervals based on the final regression model  
  - Manipulated variables by categorizing continuous predictors for contingency analysis

- **Deliverables:**  
  - R scripts implementing all analyses and tests  
  - A report including plots, results, interpretation, and discussion of statistical assumptions and findings

## üìå Wrapping Up

This course strengthened my theoretical understanding and practical skills in probability and statistics, with a focus on real-world data analysis. Through the assignments, i developed proficiency in statistical inference, hypothesis testing, regression modeling, and data visualization, primarily using **R**. The hands-on experience of applying statistical methods to clinical and multivariate datasets enhanced my ability to select appropriate techniques, interpret results critically, and communicate findings effectively in data-driven contexts.
