### üìù Assignment 2 ‚Äì Food Hazard Detection Challenge (SemEval 2025)

- **Summary:**  
  This assignment involved participating in the **Food Hazard Detection Challenge** (SemEval 2025), which focuses on identifying food safety hazards in both    short and long text descriptions. The challenge required building and evaluating machine learning models to classify text content effectively based on risk   factors.

- **Focus Areas:**  
  - Explored and preprocessed both **short texts (titles)** and **long texts (descriptions)**  
  - Developed benchmark models using classical ML algorithms (e.g. logistic regression, XGBoost)  
  - Fine-tuned transformer-based models for long text classification  
  - Compared performance metrics across different models and text types  
  - Submitted predictions and reported score and ranking from the official leaderboard  

- **Deliverables:**  
  - A complete implementation hosted in a separate GitHub repository  
  - README with detailed instructions, methodology, and evaluation results
